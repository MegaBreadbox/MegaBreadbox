## About me
&emsp; I have been developing Android apps for two years now. Look out for applications I work on here written primarily in Kotlin.
Currently I am getting Antheia ready for release on the Google Playstore. Check it out over [here](https://github.com/MegaBreadbox/Antheia).  

You can reach out to me over on megabreadbox@protonmail.com
