## About me
&emsp; I have been developing Android apps for two years now. Look out for applications I work on here written primarily in Kotlin.
Currently I released Antheia Plant Manager to the Google Playstore! Check it out over [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mega_breadbox.antheia_plant_manager).  

You can reach out to me over on megabreadbox@protonmail.com
